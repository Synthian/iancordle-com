# Ian Cordle + Jackbox = Good

Hello unspecified recruiter and/or hiring manager at Jackbox Games! Thank you for taking the time to read
why I'm interested in working at Jackbox. Looking forward to hearing from you!

### Why Jackbox?

Like so many people, I'm looking for the opportunity to combine my dearest hobby (video games) with my passion for my work (software development).
This role at Jackbox is the ideal fit to blend my existing skillset in front-end development with a role that would let me produce a product that
I really care about and has been part of my life for a very long time.

My relationship with Jackbox is not a recent development - I played Jackbox games as a kid when they were *Jellyvision* games!
I have vivid memories of gathering around my parents' Windows 98 PC to play You Don't Know Jack. Some of the first times we played,
the Jack Attack sequence freaked me out because I was so young. All of the jokes and questions went way over my head of course,
but I was a competitive kid and I relished the rare moments that I knew the answer to something. I think a large part of my love
for trivia games today should be attributed to those early days playing YDKJ.

### Games I Like

I love video games, competition, and good teamwork. My most played games this year have been
League of Legends and Final Fantasy XIV for that reason. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing a beautifully executed teamfight in League or a
well coordinated boss fight in Final Fantasy. I think that same principle extends to my work as well, I enjoy seeing my team succeed as a unit.

As for my favorite Jackbox game? Fibbage! No tie in to work philosophy on this one, I just love tricking my friends into believing my lies.

### Relevant Experience

I have 4 years experience designing and building full-stack web applications in my professional career.
I have been the lead developer on Vue and React applications, all of which have been TypeScript projects. I have generous Redis experience,
especially with Redis Streams.

In my role today I am a team lead, responsible for mentoring others and breaking down the largest problems that my team is presented with.

I still find time to do projects on my own, usually related to gaming in some way. Last year, I developed a mod for The Binding of Isaac
which added new playable characters and items. It was a full one-man project with *tons* of sprite work and *lots* of Lua scripting. I'm really proud
of how it turned out.

### More?

Thank you!
