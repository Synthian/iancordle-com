<ProjectHeader title={'iancordle.com'} subtitle={'[Typescript, React, Next.js]'} fontSize={40} githubLink={'https://github.com/Synthian/iancordle-com'} projectLink={'https://iancordle.com'} />

This website is a React application built with Next.js. All of my static content is written in Markdown files with MDX.
I'm also using Chakra as my UI Library of choice.
Everything is deployed via GitHub Pages.

<ProjectHeader title={'Bastion Auto Splitter'} subtitle={'[C#]'} fontSize={40} githubLink={'https://github.com/Synthian/LiveSplit.Bastion'}/>

Video game speedrunners want to know when they've reached a certain point in the game so they can compare their splits
against previous runs. With the help of DevilSquirrel, we built this LiveSplit plugin for Bastion players to automatically
time when they have completed each level.

<ProjectHeader title={'BastionBot'} subtitle={'[Java, Spring]'} fontSize={40} githubLink={'https://github.com/Synthian/BastionBot'}/>

BastionBot is a Discord bot that automatically tells the Bastion Speedrun Community when players have gone live on Twitch
and when new speedruns have been verified on Speedrun.com. It was recently rewritten to use the Spring Framework.

<ProjectHeader title={'Cadaver: The Rotten Expansion'} subtitle={'[Lua]'} fontSize={40} githubLink={'https://github.com/Synthian/IsaacCadaver'} projectLink={'https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2508822241'}/>

Cadaver is a mod for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance, which I have released on the Steam Workshop. It's not a technical masterpiece, but
it's my first real foray into game development of any kind. It got pretty good reviews from the community and I have 4000+ users!
