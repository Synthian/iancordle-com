This website is a React application built with Next.js. All of my static content is written in Markdown files with MDX.
I'm also using Chakra as my UI Library of choice.
Everything is deployed via GitHub Pages.

I will admit I heavily based this site off of [leerob.io](https://leerob.io). His project was a great help in putting this together.

<ProjectHeader title={'Bastion Auto Splitter'} subtitle={'[C#]'} fontSize={40} githubLink={'https://github.com/Synthian/LiveSplit.Bastion'}/>

Video game speedrunners want to know when they've reached a certain point in the game so they can compare their splits
against previous runs. With the help of DevilSquirrel, we built this LiveSplit plugin for Bastion players to automatically
time when they have completed each level.

<ProjectHeader title={'BastionBot'} subtitle={'[Java, Spring]'} fontSize={40} githubLink={'https://github.com/Synthian/BastionBot'}/>

BastionBot is a Discord bot that automatically tells the Bastion Speedrun Community when players have gone live on Twitch
and when new speedruns have been verified on Speedrun.com. It is currently being rewritten to use the Spring Framework.
