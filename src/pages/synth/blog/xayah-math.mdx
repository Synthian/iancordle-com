# Xayah Damage - Live vs PBE

*Level 11 Xayah (E -> W max)*
*Runes ignored for simplicity*

*7800g*

246 AD
50% crit chance
225% crit damage
1.09 attack speed (1.37 with W)
20% CDR

AA dps, no W: 436 physical
AA dps, with W: 657 physical
E damage per feather: 235 physical damage

### PBE Values
**Kraken Slayer + Infinity Edge + Berserker's**
*7900g*

236 AD
40% crit chance
191% crit damage
1.25 attack speed (1.53 with W)
**0% CDR**

AA dps, no W: 460 (402 physical, 58 true)
AA dps, with W: 663 (591 physical, 72 true)
E damage per feather: 214 physical damage

### Analysis

Her raw auto attack dps does go up (and part of the damage is now true damage).
This is good, but it requires her to take advange of a higher attack speed - that means more time stuck in AA animations and less ability to kite.
Overall, I expect her AA dps at 2 items probably breaks even with this taken into consideration, maybe a small boost.

You now have no cooldown reduction whatsoever. I expect to build Navori Quickblade 3rd, but I'm looking at a midgame spike here,
and IE provides the most damage by far as a 2nd item. E damage per feather is also down **9%** because of lower bonus AD and lower crit chance.

I don't think there is any other marksmen legendary you could build 2nd that would deal more damage than Infinity Edge.

Building Navori Quickblade into Infinity Edge would mirror the old build's CDR,
but you would still do less damage because of reduced crit damage and reduced crit chance and, of course, no true damage passive from Kraken Slayer.
