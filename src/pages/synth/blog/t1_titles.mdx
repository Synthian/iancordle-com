blurb: Tyler's titles already sound ridiculous, I figured an AI would do just as well...

### The Plan
Tyler1 may have a huge following on Twitch - but it certainly doesn't come from the eloquence of his stream titles.
His titles are typically an incoherent mess of capital letters and punctuation. *Not much different from how he
types to his teammates in game, I suppose...* One day I realized that it wouldn't be very difficult at all for a mediocre
AI to spit out reasonably convincing stream titles.

So, I put together a list of 1000+ of Tyler's historical stream titles, setup some Python script using textgenrnn, and started
teaching my computer how to type like a very angry League of Legends player.

### Training

I didn't have to write any code, really. This is a task that has been tackled hundreds of times by other developers, and the
textgenrnn library (along with TensorFlow) did all the hard work for me. I didn't even really have to write code to setup the
training - there was an example all ready to go that accomplished exactly what I needed. All I had to do was plug in my
list of Tyler's titles and send my neural network on its way.

***

Initially, the network was completely confused. Which makes sense - Tyler's titles confuse most humans, let alone a hastily
constructed title-bot. Here are a few titles that it came up with after 5 passes:

> #### MAME ! WATH ! ING ! ALLLE ! WAT ! WALLLE ! WALLLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

> #### T1 GO ! SE MAST DAVE SIC ALLE ! ! UNS THAT ! AWHA DAS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

> #### ANMAN COND AND AALL TINS ! ING ! LUST ! ULCHE !!!

LUST ! ULCHE !!! Although the words make absolutely no sense, the model has already clearly grasped the pattern with spaces
and exclamation marks in between pretty much every word in T1's titles.

***

Perhaps now is a good time to mention **temperature.** The model allows you to ask for different temperatures of results:
the higher the temperature, the more "creative" the result. After 10 passes through my data, a low temperature result looked like this:

> #### T1 DOOM ! HE GO ! HE BE GO ! TOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

while a high temperature result looked more like this:

> #### BICH E STRAME !!!! BUS MAN ALLEDED . T1 UNSFIAN DOVER BENERFERABLE

***

After 20 training sessions, which was the the default training duration from the example, I started getting some seriously crazy title
suggestions. One that particularly impressed me:

> #### T1 BAT MAN WOW ! ALWAY ! HE GO !!!!!

I looked through my sample data: "bat" only showed up 3 times and it was only in the word "battle" - this was a *completely* original
title and I would have believed that Tyler wrote this if I didn't know better. The number of exclamation marks was more reasonable than
my earlier results, it split "BATMAN" apart into two separate words for no discernible reason, and it misspelled "always." It's perfect!

I'm pretty sure that an AI could be writing T1's titles right now and we would never notice.

### Extra Content

I generated 1000 titles with my new model. You can see all 1000 of those titles [here](/t1_titles.txt) but I've taken out a few of my favorites:

> #### GREAT SPEED ATHLESTIC LEAGES ! NO IS HE ! WOOT ! STRONG ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

> #### T1 BIG GENES ALWAY STOMP ! ALL THE WINGER !!!

> #### AHHHHHAHHAHHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

> #### BIGT ! NOT ! STOP ! GOES ! HE GO !

> #### T1 ALL ! ME STRONG ! IT STOP ! hee . NO !!

> #### ! T1 !! STRONG ! THIS ? NO BIG THIS MAN !!!!!!

> #### IS LAY OF THE WINES ! HOW HAHAHA ALL THE GAY !!!!

> #### CAN COPS AGAIN DO BIG ! THAT ! SOP ! HE GOOO !!!!!!!!!!
