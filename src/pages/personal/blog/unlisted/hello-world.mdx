#### Hello World!
Welcome to my obscure piece of the web!

The main page, [iancordle.com](www.iancordle.com), is a portfolio-cum-resume that focuses on my more professional work.
The Synth pages, iancordle.com/synth/... are focused on personal projects and content that don't need to be front and
center to future recruiters.

In the future, I expect to host complicated apps on subdomains. If I were to release a trivia app for instance, it would
be found at trivia.iancordle.com rather than hosting it here. There are technical reasons for this, but I shan't
elaborate on them now. (This isn't supposed to be a *particularly* technical blog post)

#### Blog Content?
I am not a writer, per se, but I do have some opinions about games. Plus, what web developer doesn't have a blog where
they tell you why their favorite framework is *the right one?*

I would also like to have some friends' content on the site, even if the website is very **me**-branded.

#### Tech Stack?
This website is open source and is roughly based on leerob.io's tech stack (a great open source portfolio!) I encourage
you to take a look at [the repository](https://github.com/Synthian/iancordle-com) if you're interested in learning more.
