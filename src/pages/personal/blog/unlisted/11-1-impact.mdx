***

*Champions listed by u.gg as bot carries on patch 10.25, in winrate order (Platinum+)*

➖ Swain

➖Tristana

➖ Jhin

❌ **Kai'sa** - I think losing the scaling bolt damage on Runaan's will impact her a bit. Maybe her build path changes in 11.1

❌ **Miss Fortune** - Muramana nerf probably means she goes back to another build with a slightly lower winrate.

➖ Vayne

➖ Ashe

❌ **Twitch** - He has a great two item spike right now with the stronger Runaan's bolts,
I think going back to weak bolts will hurt a lot, as most games are decided on 1/2 items.
Having Runaan's earlier might compensate a bit but my hunch is that it will hurt his solo queue success.

➖ Draven

➖ Kog'Maw

➖ Lucian

❌ **Jinx** - Same situation as Twitch. She still has to get Runaan's second, but losing the scaling on the bolts is going to
hurt a lot for her teamfight strength as the game goes on.

➖ Kalista

➖ Samira

❌ **Senna** - I think the Muramana nerf will hit Senna, even though there are non-Muramana builds that are just as good.
(People are not building those right now)

➖ Caitlyn

➖ Sivir

❌ **Aphelios** - He might be the most well equipped to survive the Runaan's changes, but I'm not sure. I'll still predict a slight nerf.

✔️ **Xayah** - Direct buffs will obviously increase winrate, but I think this one is mostly placebo.
E is maxed first, and is not spammed on cooldown in lane, so the cooldown change should go mostly unnoticed.

❌❌ **Ezreal** - He will notice the Muramana changes the most.
I did some practice tool testing, and found that his DPS slightly decreased *and* and cost of Manamune went up 300g.
That's a significant nerf for an already underperforming champion.

➖ Varus
