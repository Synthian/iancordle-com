# Crosswords
##### *By Ian Cordle*

I write themed crossword puzzles, usually in the Tuesday-Wednesday (NYT Scale) difficulty range.

Puzzles I've just written for fun, or that don't make the cut at any publication will end up here, playable on Crosshare.
If any puzzles do get published, they will also be listed here, with details of how to access them. Enjoy!
