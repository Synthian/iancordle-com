#### About Me
I started tinkering with programming when I got into video game modding in middle school. I
didn't really know what I was doing, but it helped me decide pretty early that I was going to go into software development.
I took all the programming classes available to me in high school, tinkered as much as I could on my own, and eventually
graduated from Penn State with a degree in Computer Science. <sup>magna cum laude</sup>

<p>I am now {new Date().getFullYear() - 1996}, living and working in Pittsburgh as a full-stack developer for FedEx Services.</p>

In my free time, I am a MOBA enthusiast, a speedrunner, a parent of Discord bots, and a burgeoning photographer.
