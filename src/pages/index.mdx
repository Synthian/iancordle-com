#### About Me
<p>I am a {new Date().getFullYear() - 1996}-year-old full stack software developer who likes building web applications and services that drive user experiences. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà</p>

I've loved computers since I was a kid, messing around on a hand-me-down Windows 95 PC in my parents' office. I spent so much time on that old PC that some of the earliest
words I could read were File, Edit, and View!

As soon as I was introduced to the internet, I was hooked. I built my own websites and I got involved with video game modding, banding together with other inexperienced middle-schoolers who I'm still friends with today.

I was sure that I wanted to work with computers and that continued into college at Penn State, where I graduated from Penn State with a degree in Computer Science <sup>magna cum laude!</sup>

Currently, I'm a Full-Stack Developer at FedEx Services. I have worked on a wide variety of projects, with my core proficiencies being Java, Spring, React, Redis, and Jenkins (see [Experience](./experience) for a full list).

Outside of work, I am a huge video game nerd: League of Legends, Final Fantasy XIV, and any Dark Souls game (just to name a few). I also enjoy writing and performing music, recently I've started self-learning piano and taking additional
music production classes.
