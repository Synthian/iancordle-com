#### About Me
<p>I am a {new Date().getFullYear() - 1996}-year-old full stack software developer who likes building web and mobile applications.</p>

I grew up on the internet surrounded by video games and websites - and I wanted to make them myself.
As a kid, I built dozens of (terrible) websites that nobody would ever see. I enjoyed those early projects so much
that I was convinced that I wanted to go into software development.
I graduated from Penn State with a degree in Computer Science <sup>magna cum laude</sup> and currently work as a full-stack
developer for FedEx Services.

In my free time, I am a MOBA enthusiast, a speedrunner, a parent of Discord bots, and a world travel lover.
