### DICK'S Sporting Goods - Consumer Mobile Intern
###### Summer 2017
While I interned at DICK'S, I became part of the Agile team that developed the Android mobile app and was assigned stories
like any other developer. There are a few things in the app today that I developed while I was an intern,
so this was my first time actually affecting production code.
